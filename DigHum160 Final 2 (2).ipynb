       " 'I just sent him the following email:\\n\\nHello, Mr. Congressman,\\n\\nI am not a part of your constituency, not even a US Citizen. Perhaps you might think that reading this is not worthy of your time.\\n\\nHowever, I want to let you know something.\\n\\nI am from Mexico, have been all my life. I am accomplished businessman, have studied in the United States, and have a love for many things \"American\". I also dislike many things about the US. I often feel bewildered that I have such strong feelings for a foreign country, when China, which is also very strong, very big, and very populated, fails to elicit such strong feelings in me. Why do I love, or why am I annoyed, with parts of America?\\n\\nIt could be that the USA is close to me, physically. But so is Guatemala and I don\\'t care about them. It could, maybe, be that it has a huge impact in my life. American spending affects the economy of my nation. American culture impacts me deeply. American foreign policy makes my own nation more, or less, safe. America does so many things that affects me directly that I feel threatened by it, sometimes, and other times, enlightened by it. Your country is, no doubt, the greatest in the World.\\n\\nBut no matter how much I disagree with America\\'s policies in the past 9 years, particularly regarding military or economic progress, one of the things I will never hold against the US is what they teach. America loves freedom, loves dedication, loves egalitarianism, loves hard work, loves rewards based on merit, loves justice, and loves progress.\\n\\nIronically, the reason I know this, is because I grew up listening to Michael Jackson. His lyrics, his music, enlightened my way and made me believe in things that are alien to the idiosyncrasy of my own nation. These values, that I learned from him and his music, are what make me different, successful, and give me the power to make a positive change, a contribution for those who need it most (a majority in my country). This humanitarian spirit is something I also learned from his songs.\\n\\nMichael Jackson was a monument to American Exceptionalism. Why is America great? Because it believes in the things that Michael Jackson sang. Added to that, no one could dance, produce a video, market a show, or enchant an audience the way he did. He is, without fear of exageration, our generation\\'s Mozart. A troubled man with a genius for music, and a passion for making the world different. This, my dear Congressman, is what, in my opinion, makes America great. It is the reason why I admire your country, and the reason why I love it, despite its shortcomings and despite the fear I have of it.\\n\\nI am sorry, but I have to say that, no only am I saddened, but I am also insulted, that you suggest that whatever honors are being suggested for Michael are \"exaggerated\". Your insinuation that the man was less than what he was, based on accusations that could never be proven, is uncalled for. This sort of disrespect for the talented, dismissal of the facts, and mistrust of the new, is exactly what is relegating and destroying America. Michael Jackson is more than a man. He is a symbol and a legend. He personifies a very important aspect for your country. At least, he does this for me, a foreigner, and for many foreigners around the world. Do you really want that symbol destroyed? That legend forgotten? And with what would you replace it? Accusations of torture, of unjust wars, of excessive, lavish, lifestyles, and a desire for revenge?\\n\\nHonoring Michael, at least for the benefit of those of all who saw good in him, hurts no one. Ignoring his legacy, and burying it, would hurt America. \\n\\nI beg you, Mr. Congressman, do not let this historic opportunity go to waste. It is true that Michael Jackson was no Mother Teresa. He was, however, a genius with a good heart. He had, like all of us have, shortcomings. This is, however, no reason to diminish his legacy. God gave us a gift in him. Let\\'s not send him back to heaven as something we would rather not have. On the contrary, we need more people who express these American values as clearly, as vividly, and as passionately as Michael did in his life.\\n\\nPlease, don\\'t honor Michael for him. Honor him for us. It will make America better, and I will love your country more for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time and reading my email.',\n",

What it says is that Michael was good at entertaining and giving money away for charity, none of which can be claimed false! So, why would anyone oppose it? \\n\\nEven if Michael was indeed proven to have done whatever it is they accuse him of, the resolution doesn't condone these actions. They just rewards his music and his charity. Is this so bad?\\n\\nI think that opposing something like this does more harm than good.\",\n",

Robin Williams just forgot to put too much characteristic evident political corruption in Brazil.\\n\\nWith nothing to declare on cocaine, girls programs - which are not welcomed in a hypocritical society immersed in the darkness of Christianity - and almost everything against corrupt politicians, I can still applause by the great films that Robin Williams has starred in, among they majestic Bicentennial Man. In time, we also have nothing to declare on the Robin Williams joke about Rio to host the Olympic Games but the fact that it was funny and I earned good laughs.\\n\\nBut Globo did not like, and the design of anything serious journalist William Wack, who manages to get worse as the respondent-fat propaganda Jô Soares, has highlighted his face neglect of the actor perfectly understandable not like the joke from Robin Williams and even himself. However, in a time of Zeca Camargo, Arnaldo Jabor, Christiane Pelajo, Pedro Bial, Faustão, William Wack himself and many others who did not lose out, it seems that Globo is not in a position to want to give lessons in morality the Robin Williams and anyone else.\\n\\n[Update - 01/12/2009]\\n\\nIn view of the comments which highlights some similar thoughts, especially a vision of arrogance on the part of Robin Williams and a supposed lack of commitment by the author with Brazil, also add a few more words. Who can say if Robin Williams had an arrogant attitude or the joke, so laugh, is none other than Robin Williams himself. Words and ideas are unable to communicate attitudes and feelings when taken without the experience of being in the presence of another, but we can affect the other\\'s thoughts, and many will affect the attitude of seeing actor arrogant, other so for me to come was the laughter.\\n\\nDoes not condone the policies of the United States, and also does not condone the Brazilian politics, which in other words is nothing but a U.S. policy with less power. Robin Williams does not represent U.S. policy, not spoke for a nation, as Robin Williams said it is not only a citizen of his country, but a man like any other that is not limited only to legal barriers and policies.\\n\\nStill, because I am Brazilian I do not feel obliged to defend situations that reality itself, it seems to me, is there to contradict. While it is a stranger saying \"nasty things\" in the country where I live, the patriotic ideal, that yes, the arrogance, not in itself justify taking the pain of a nation.\\n\\nReiterating what I think of more fundamental: Robin Williams did not speak as a politician on behalf of a nation, therefore, do not make sense to say that seeing the situation from the standpoint of laughter is settle for an America\\'s vision of debauchery against Brazil ... Still, a Brazil that is very Americanized, the language of feelings!\\n\\nAsk ourselves what is the vision we have of Islam? African countries? Chinese? And not have to go far, as we learn to define the Cubans? Argentines? Colombians? I am asking you, who are the Brazilians who are hurt by the laughter of Robin Williams, will be the same as applauding the CQC? - Certainly not all, but a large majority.\\n\\nAnd what of the foreign multinationals that often applaud the Brazilians? Or privatization that many insist is better? Even made noise when Japan patented acai, genuinely Australian product that is now operated by the Brazilian bourgeois Brazilian northeast.\\n\\nIt seems clear that taking the statements of an individual who does not speak as a politician within view of a patriotic ideal, is too ridiculous when the situation is even more shameless.\\n\\nLaughter, when spontaneous, should not any justification for any moral, much less patriotic!\\n',\n",

       " \"10 point guide for committed progressives to fight imperialistic capitalists oppressing the working classes all over the world.\\n\\n(1) If you live in a house, condominium or apartment, move. Into the street, if necessary. But not to a shelter. All shelters receive some charity (which is a capitalist tool of oppression) one way or another-either getting money directly from capitalists or (even more perfidious) using proletariat donations.\\n\\n(2) Don't ever buy anything in any retail store. They are all owned by greedy capitalist swine and are a tool of oppression of the proletariat which is exploited there, either working for a slave-wage or buying the stuff at exorbitant prices that go directly to capitalist swine wallets.\\n\\n(3)  If you're need medication just say no! All the exorbitant profits go directly to big pharma fat cats greedy capitalist swine. Self-medicate,  but only with self-grown weed, or one grown in Kalifornia.\\n\\n(4) If you ever get sick don't go to the doctor. Those bastards do everything for dirty profit and in the process enrich all kind of capitalist swine.\\n\\n(5) You can keep your kids in school though. They will get better indoctrination than you can ever give them yourself. But if you are really purist, beware they still get stuff made by capitalist swine.\\n\\n(6)  Stay off the streets. All streets, roads and highways in America are capitalist. Some greedy, proletariat oppressing capitalist swine got the government contract to build/maintain them. Besides, you can't buy gas without stuffing the wallets of greedy oil barons.\\n\\n(7) Stay off the sidewalks. They're just as capitalist as the streets, if not moreso.\\n\\n(8) Stop using municipal water. Municipal water is capitalist (they send you a bill every month, don't they?) Use only water nobody makes profit from.\\n\\n(9) Tell the fire department to screw off. Notify your local fire department that if your house catches on fire, you do not want them to come.  All their equipment and uniforms were made by blood sucking, greedy capitalists. Some of them are even privately funded by greedy capitalist swine!\\n\\n(10) Tell the police to screw off, too! Notify your local police department that you don't need their help if anyone steals your stuff, or tries to kill you or anything like that. As above.\",\n",

It’s about the mind on strike - the thinkers, the doers, the creators - whether they are rich (like the banker Midas Mulligan) or poor (like the young brakeman and others). \\n \\nLooking at it critically, you see that many of the villains in the story are richer than all of the heroes put together (James Taggart tosses $100 bills to bums) but they’re rich through government pull (sounds a lot like wealthy businessmen, lobbyists, contractors, Wall Street elite, etc. doesn\\'t it?).\\n \\nAs the character Francisco D’Anconia says at the end of his famous Money Speech in the book: “When you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - When you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - When you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you -When you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice -You may know that your society is doomed”\\n\\nIf anything, Atlas is a warning about our current crony culture of corporate owned politicians and the lobbyists who buy them.',\n",

Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat.\\n\\n\\nShe was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.\\n\\n\\nOne day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the addition of more government welfare programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school.\\n\\n\\nTaken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn\\'t even have time for a boyfriend, and didn\\'t really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying. \\n\\n\\nHer father listened and then asked, \"How is your friend Audrey doing?\" She replied, \"Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast. She\\'s always invited to all the parties, and lots of times she doesn\\'t even show up for classes because she\\'s too hung over.\"\\n\\n\\nHer wise father asked his daughter, \"Why don\\'t you go to the Dean\\'s office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.\"\\n\\n\\nThe daughter, visibly shocked by her father\\'s suggestion, angrily fired back, \"That wouldn\\'t be fair! I have worked really hard for my grades! I\\'ve invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!\"\\n\\nThe father slowly smiled, winked and said gently, “Welcome to the Republican party.\"\\n\\n\\n====================================\\n \\n\\n**Number 2:**\\n \\nI asked my friend\\'s little girl what she wanted to be when she grows up. She said she wanted to be President some day. Both of her parents, liberal Democrats, were standing there, so I asked her, \\'If you were President what would be the first thing you would do?\\'\\n\\nShe replied, \\'I\\'d give food and houses to all the homeless people.\\'\\n\\n\\'Wow...what a worthy goal.\\' I told her, \\'You don\\'t have to wait until you\\'re President to do that. You can come over to my house and mow, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I\\'ll pay you $50. Then I\\'ll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.\\'\\n\\nShe thought that over for a few seconds while her Mom glared at me, then she looked me straight in the eye and asked, \\'Why doesn\\'t the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?\\'\\n\\nI said, \\'Welcome to the Republican Party.\\'\\n\\n',\n",
